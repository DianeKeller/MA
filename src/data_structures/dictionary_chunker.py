class DictionaryChunker(LoggingMixin, CheckpointMixin):
    """
    DictionaryChunker class.

    This class splits a large dictionary into smaller chunks returned one by
    one. It keeps track of the generated and returned chunks by creating a
    checkpoint each time a chunk is returned and restarts where it left off
    if the program is interrupted and restarted.

    Attributes
    ----------
    chunk_size : int
        The number of items in each chunk. Defaults to 10.

    current_chunk : int
        The current chunk number, which keeps track of the progress.

    dic : Dict[str, Any]
        The dictionary to be chunked.

    iterator : Iterator
        An iterator over the dictionary items, used to yield chunks.

    name : str
        The name used for checkpointing. Defaults to 'chunk'.

    Methods
    -------
    get_next_chunk(self) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], int]:
        Gets the next chunk.

    Notes
    -----
    - If the program is interrupted, the chunker resumes from the last
      returned chunk based on the checkpoint saved previously.

    - If the dictionary is exhausted, further calls to 'get_next_chunk'
      will return empty chunks.
